	  Lightrec is a MIPS-to-everything dynamic recompiler for PlayStation emulators, using GNU Lightning as the code emitter.
          As such, in theory it should be able to run on every CPU that Lightning can generate code for; including, 
          but not limited to, x86, x86_64, ARM, Aarch64, MIPS, PowerPC and Risc-V.
